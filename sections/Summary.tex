\section{Summary}

\subsection{motivation}
When a piece of code is really hot, the profiler will request an optimized compilation. This will create another, even faster version of this code which will also be stored.
The idea of Tracing is after identify the hot code, the hot code will be compiled 
\subsection{contribution}
The contributions of this paper are:
• Applying a tracing JIT compiler to an interpreter.
• Finding techniques for improving the generated code.
\subsection{methodology and/or argument}
\cite{bolz2009tracing} make some experiment to test their theory for performance gain about tracing and optimize hot code for the pypy interpreter, they have runned the small examples about the a square function
\subsection{conclusion}
THey have seen thanks to the resut that the tracing and optimisation of code works well but that their is some downside,
which can be the overhead of using two interperters for the same program.
