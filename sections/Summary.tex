\section{Summary}

\subsection{motivation}
When a piece of code is really hot, the profiler will request an optimized compilation. This will create another, even faster version of this code which will also be stored.

The contributions of this paper are:
• Applying a tracing JIT compiler to an interpreter.
• Finding techniques for improving the generated code.
